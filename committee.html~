		<h3 class="committee_title">Diarmuid Ryan - Captain</h3>
		
		<p>From Royal Co. Meath, this year&#146s Captain has many achievements to his name, the most notable being his ascension to the throne of UCDCC. Our newest &#147slave-driver&#148 began his quest for the throne by sabotaging other committee members during his tenure as Quippie. Not really though- he learned his lesson about minding gear the hard way. He is now always last out to ensure nothing gets left behind or thrown away. Since he began kayaking in his fresher year, Diarmuid has embraced all things kayaking. He even joined the ranks of engineers-turned-computer-scientists that are scattered through the club.

		<h3 class="committee_title">Marie Harrington - Secretary</h3>
		
		<p>Our secretary for 2013/2014 comes from beautiful County Cork. Marie has been kayaking since 2011 and is in final year Veterinary Medicine. She was hypnotised from a young age by the kayaking she saw in the Olympics. The sight of Bill in a paddling pool in full kayaking gear may also have helped pique her interest in this new world. Marie has won the Dee Cup, was second in the Ball Boater-X and second in the Women&#146s GP at Intervarsities. She has shown her prowess in all disciplines of kayaking, except polo. Marie didn&#146t really like polo, which is surprising as she&#146s usually pretty good at throwing balls around pitches!

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Ross Kerrigan - Treasurer</h3>
		  
		  <p>This year&#146s treasurer is a kayaking veteran. Ross is going into his third year of Mechanical Engineering and hopes to team this with Business after graduating. He has been kayaking since secondary school in Rockwell College where his English teacher was also a kayaking instructor. He juggled kayaking and rugby for a few years until he found his true calling. Once he started college, Ross immediately joined the canoe club where he quickly learned that there is more to kayaking than water. With a habit of breaking other people&#146s paddles it seemed only natural that we put Ross in charge of expenses.</p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Niall Finch - Safety Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>This year we have a Wicklow man to care for our safety. Having spent years looking at the Dargle from his house, Niall has become very good at reading rivers, a skill he honed in a summer trip to the Alps. A Geologist in training, Niall chose kayaking not for the rapids and the drops, but to get a good close look at all those pretty rocks in rivers around the world. He frequently tries to claim that these close ups with rocks are not the reason for that recurring head injury. He still blames rugby and bunk-beds for those mishaps, the rest of us are not convinced! </p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Steven Mulrooney - Training Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>As his bio picture shows, our training officer is still having a little difficulty differentiating between kayaking and lifeguarding. From Avoca in Co. Wicklow, Steven is starting second year Food Science and has been kayaking since he started college. Steven joined because of his love of water and has since found that he has quite an affinity for the kayaking aspect too. It took a while before he realised the point of kayaking was to stay above water level and he is now more than willing to pass on his newfound knowledge. </p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Deividas Raineys - Equipment Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Our &#147Quippy&#148 for 2013/2014 continues the trend of engineering efficiency in the club. Originally from Lithuania, David is now living in Enfield. He joined the club in order to make a few new friends in the melting pot that is UCD. He is still unsure as to whether Diarmuid pressured or persuaded him into joining the club, but he took the plunge and is now incapable of leaving. David went to secondary school in Kilcock with Diarmuid and must have picked something up in the water out there as he too now worships at the altar of polo. He has also left his gear in a black bag on the side of a canal. We really need to do something about the habits of the Equipment Officers…</p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Helena Coughlan - Public Relations Officer</h3>
		  
		  <p>Another proud Corkonian will be keeping you updated throughout the year with all our plans and shenanagins. Helena is in final year Ag Science and started kayaking in second year after she too saw Bill in a paddling pool. With an interest in field sports, she naturally gravitated towards polo. She had forsaken rivers in favour of polo for a while, but now she occasionally finds herself back on moving water, trying to hand roll and pushing anything in her way. She has also made it a goal to educate all the townies on where their food actually comes from (hint: “the shop” is not a favourable answer).</p>

		  <h3 class="committee_title">Aoife Sheridan - New Members Liason</h3>
		  
		  <p>The 2013/2014 NML is well briefed in kayaking and can assuage any fear that new members may have. As a nursing student, she has also perfected the art of that “no nonsense tone” all nurses seem to have, so she knows when to be nice and when you might need a boot down the river! Her family have a history of slalom and K1 paddling and Aoife herself has also lived through a Junior Liffey Descent. After a brief hiatus she has made an (almost) successful comeback to kayaking in November and is now ready to pass on her knowledge to the next generation. </p>
